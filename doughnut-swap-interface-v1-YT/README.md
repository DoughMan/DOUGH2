[DoughnutSwap](https://doughnutswap.shop/) is an automated market maker (‚Äú**AMM**‚Äù) that allows two tokens to be exchanged on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) (BSC). It is fast, cheaper than Doughnutswap, and allows everyone & anyone fair access.

This repo is responsible for the **exchange** interface of the AMM: [exchange.doughnutswap.shop](https://exchange.doughnutswap.shop/)
